# Javascript Airport Challenge

A reimplementation of [this project](https://github.com/adc17/airport_challenge) in Javascript. Planes can take off and land at airports, provided there is no stormy weather. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:adc17/javascript-airport-challenge.git`

## Usage

This project doesn't really do anything, it just maps the workings of a very simple airport. But you can run its test files by opening `SpecRunner.html` in your web browser.

## Other notes

Completed during week five of the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) Bootcamp.
